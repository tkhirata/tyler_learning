#Go back through and write a comment on what each line does.

#Reach each one backward or out loud to find your errors.

#From now on, when you make mistakes, write down on a piece of paper what kind of mistake you made.

#When you go to the next exercise, look at the last mistakes you made and try not to make them in this new one.

#Remember that everyone makes mistakes. Programmers are like magicians who like everyone to think they are perfrect
#wrong, but it's all an act. They make mistakes all the time.
