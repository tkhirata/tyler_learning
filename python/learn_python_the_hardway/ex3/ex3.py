'''
+ plus: Adds two intigers together
- minus: Subtracts two intigers
/ slash: Divides two intigers and turn it into a float
* asterisk: Multiplies two intigers
% percent: Modulus, returns the remainder of two intigers
< less-than: Checks condition and returns boolean value
> greater-than: Checks condition and returns boolean value
<= less-than-equal: Checks condition and returns boolean value
>= greater-than-equal: Checks condition and returns boolean value
